## Documentation
Panicroom is a complex and intricate Enviroment of multiple Languages and Usecases.
For this Reason we are momentarily focused on the Documentation of the Base-game alone.
**We also appreciate feedback to improve its wording, formatting and Navigation!**

We currently have two Types of Documentations:
1. **The Wiki** is for Player and content creator. It contains the most elements found in the Game and lists their attributes. We keep the Technical terms at a minimum. Most of it is maintained by our Automation.
2. **The Docs** is for Developer. It contains more Abstract explanations about our Framework and usefull functioncalls of Modules like in an API-doc.Developer may still want to use the Wiki to get specific Info or examples.
